Hi there, I'm Jugaad 👋
I'm a Data Science enthusiast with a strong foundation in Mathematics, currently pursuing my Master's at the Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI). My journey has taken me from the theoretical depths of a Mathematics (Hons) degree at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) to the practical world of business analytics, and now into the exciting field of data science.

I'm passionate about finding elegant solutions to complex problems and have a keen interest in performance optimization, particularly in using C to supercharge Python code.

🚀 What I'm Up To
🧠 Diving deep into advanced data science and machine learning concepts in my Master's program (2024-2026).

💻 Exploring new ways to apply my background in mathematics and business analysis to build robust data models.

🐍 Actively working on projects where I can optimize data-heavy Python applications.

🤝 Open to collaborating on open-source projects related to data science, machine learning, or performance engineering.

🏆 My Projects
Here are a few projects I'm proud of. You can find more of my work in my repositories.

♟️ Chess Engine: A fully functional chess engine built from scratch. It uses advanced algorithms like alpha-beta pruning and move ordering heuristics to play competitively. A great exercise in complex logic and AI.

🚚 Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver: An optimization model designed to solve the classic VRP. It helps find the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles, a project that combines my interest in algorithms and real-world logistics.

🍇 Climate Change & Wine Production: A data analysis project investigating the impact of climate change on grapevine yields and quality. This involves time-series analysis and predictive modeling to forecast future trends for viticulture.
